# Terraform AWS Datasync module

[A Work in progress]
developed for Terraform < 0.10

Currently supports an AWS S3 location to an NFS location which can be either AWS EFS or any NFS server.
This module was created to sync an AWS S3 Bucket to an AWS EFS file-system. security groups in the module reflect that.

A more through documentation might be added later as well as functionality. depending on how much time I get to invest in it.
Open PRs, Fork, whatever you choose, you're welcome to it.
